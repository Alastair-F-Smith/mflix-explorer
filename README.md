# Read me


This project creates a Java application that uses a MongoDB database which contains a list of movies, movie comments, reviews and users along with other details. This application allows users to query certain fields within the database, while following the spring architecture layout: Entities->Repository->Service->Controller We implement RestAPIs and endpoints to allow the following CRUD methods.

    GET /web/movies/add-city: Adds a new movie.
    GET /web/movie: Retrieves all movies.
    GET /web/movie/{id}: Retrieves a movie by its ID.
    GET /web/movie/delete/{id}: Deletes a movie by its ID.

    The above is similar for the comments and theaters and users controller
